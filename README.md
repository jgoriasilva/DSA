# Interviewing studies

This repository contains some of my studies for diverse interview process, mostly involving Data Structures and Algorithms.

I have implemented some data structures from scratch with Python and it can be found in the folder `data_structures/`.

I have not included all my solutions here, I'll probably do it slowly over time, in the folder `leetcode/`. For now, all my solutions can be seen at my LeetCode account [here](https://leetcode.com/u/jgoriasilva/).

I have also included some folders for company-specific studies, such as `amazon/` and `datadog/`, which contains questions I took from Glassdoor reviews, Reddit communities and LeetCode discussions.
