# Data Structures &amp; Algorithms

This repository contains some of my studies involving Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as some solutions for LeetCode problems.

I have implemented some data structures from scratch with Python and it can be found in the folder `data_structures/`.

I have not included all my solutions here, I'll probably do it slowly over time, in the folder `leetcode/`. For now, all my solutions can be seen at my LeetCode account [here](https://leetcode.com/u/jgoriasilva/).
